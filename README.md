SnackClubNFT
SnackClubNFT is a blockchain-based contract that utilizes the Ethereum network to offer tiered membership NFTs, leveraging the ERC1155 standard for multi-token management. This contract allows members to mint NFTs corresponding to different membership tiers, each with its own price and benefits.

Key Features
Multi-Tier Membership: Offers three distinct tiers of membership - Adamantium, Vibranium, and Dragonite, each with a specific ether value.
Flexible Pricing: Allows the contract owner to adjust the price of each membership tier as needed.
ERC1155 Standard: Employs the ERC1155 standard for efficient multi-token management and transactions.
Customizable Base URI: Supports setting and updating the base URI for token metadata, enabling dynamic content association.
Secure Ownership: Built on the OpenZeppelin framework to ensure secure ownership and access control.
How It Works
Members can acquire membership by minting NFTs at their chosen tier, paying the corresponding ether amount. The contract ensures transactions are valid and secures ownership of minted NFTs to the buyer's address. Owners have exclusive rights to modify tier prices and the base URI, reflecting the flexibility and control over the membership dynamics.

Getting Started
To interact with the contract, users must have a compatible Ethereum wallet and sufficient ether to cover the cost of the desired membership tier and transaction fees.
